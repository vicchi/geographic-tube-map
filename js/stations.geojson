It is also the only terminal station in London to host only diesel trains, having no electrified lines. From 1967 for many years it was served only by diesel multiple-unit trains (DMUs). Occasionally special trains hauled by diesel or steam locomotives also visit Marylebone. Two new platforms have been added recently to cope with an increase in services and a growing number of passengers. Marylebone is in Travelcard Zone 1.",

The London Underground station serves the Jubilee line and the Bank branch of the Northern line. It consists of a ticket hall and entrance area with its main frontage on Tooley Street, along with entrances and exits on Borough High Street, as well as within the mainline station concourse and the corridor under the through platforms (currently 1-6).

It is on the High Barnet branch of the Northern Line, between Highgate and Tufnell Park. It is in both Travelcard zones 2 and 3. Originally named Highgate (although Archway Tavern had been proposed) the Leslie Green designed station opened on 22 June 1907 and faced in Green's standard ox-blood glazed brick. It was opened as one of the northern terminals of what was then the Charing Cross, Euston & Hampstead Railway (CCE&HR). In 1930 the station was upgraded with escalators to replace the original lifts and the secondary entrance was replaced with a modern design by Charles Holden, virtually identical to one he built at the same time at Hammersmith. Holden's station was replaced in the 1970s. In 1939, the line was extended to Highgate, and later East Finchley station as part of the New Works Programme. The station was renamed Highgate (Archway) (after the nearby high road bridge over Archway Road), then Archway (Highgate), before becoming simply Archway with the Highgate name being reassigned to the new station constructed beneath the London and North Eastern Railway (LNER) surface station of the same name. The layout of the platforms and underground passenger areas still reflect the station's former role as a terminus. The platform walls once featured the distinctive and elegantly simple tiling schemes used by Holden on the underground stations constructed at this time. Cream tiles were used throughout with the station name band formed of letter shaped tiles inset into a background of cream tiles incised to accept the lettering. Similar tiling schemes can be seen at the neighbouring Highgate, as well as at Bethnal Green and the stations on the tunnelled section of the Hainault branch of the Central Line. All were built in the late 1930s\/early 1940s. The tiles at Archway were replaced several years ago during retiling works. During the tunneling of the tunnel between Archway and Highgate, a major pipe was cut through and flooded the tunnel.",

The station is on the Northern Line between Charing Cross and Tottenham Court Road, and the Piccadilly Line between Piccadilly Circus and Covent Garden. It is in Travelcard Zone 1. On early Tube plans, the station was listed as Cranbourn Street, but the present name was used when the station was first opened by the Great Northern, Piccadilly and Brompton Railway on 15 December 1906. Like other stations on the original sections of the Piccadilly and Northern Lines, the station was originally constructed with lifts providing access to the platforms. The increase in passenger numbers in the 1920s as the Northern line was extended north and south and the expected further increase from the 1930s extensions of the Piccadilly Line lead to the reconstruction of the station below ground in the early 1930s. New station entrances were constructed to a new sub-surface ticket hall. As with the similar sub-surface ticket hall previously built at Piccadilly Circus this was excavated partially under the roadway. From there banks of escalators were provided down to both sets of platforms. The redundant lifts were removed but the lift shaft remains in use as a ventilation shaft hidden behind a small door on the first landing of the Cranbourn street entrance stairs. The redeveloped station opened in 1935. The escalators down to the Piccadilly Line were the longest on the entire Underground network, being 54\u00a0m (177\u00a0ft) in length, until the rebuilding and reopening of Angel in 1992, which overtook Leicester Square with its 60\u00a0m (197\u00a0ft) escalators. Offices above the red terracotta station building on the east side of Charing Cross Road were once occupied by the Northern Line management staff but now have a variety of functions in addition to the Northern line management, with Piccadilly line management and other support functions including a training centre on the first floor. The building, known as Transad House, was in its early years, occupied by the publishers of the Wisden Cricketers' Almanack and an image of cricket stumps appears above a door way. The station is featured briefly during the introductory video sequence of the sixth Harry Potter film. On all four platforms, film sprockets are painted down the entire length and on the top and bottom of the display area (blue on the Piccadilly line platforms, and black on the Northern line platforms), due to the four premiere cinemas in Leicester Square.",

The station was opened on 22 June 1907 by the Charing Cross, Euston &amp; Hampstead Railway. Although close to Junction Road railway station on the Tottenham &amp; Hampstead Junction Railway, there was never a physical connection between the two stations. The station was modernised in 2004 by Tube Lines; major items of works were the communication systems, a complete retiling and new ceilings throughout. Ticket Gates were installed some time later. The station also houses a large industrial ventilation fan as part of London Undergrounds Cooling the Tube project. The fan runs year round along with fans at other Northern line locations. As of summer 2012, to coincide with the London Summer Olympics, Wi-Fi services began at Tufnell Park station, provided by Virgin Media. The station benefits from 2 Passenger Operated Ticket Machines(POMs)and a morning ticket office service during the week, 07:15-11:45 Monday to Friday and weekend services, Saturday 08:30-15:00 and Sunday 09:45-14:30.

There is no ground-level station building, access being by ramps and stairs to a modern station entrance which is part of a small shopping parade beneath the roundabout. The original ground-level buildings were removed when the roundabout was constructed. The station has toilets, but they are not open late into the evening.

From Aylesbury a shuttle service to Princes Risborough provides access to through services between Marylebone and Birmingham Snow Hill. The journey times to Central London range between 33 and 60 minutes. Ticket barriers are in operation at this station. In 2009, because of financial constraints, Transport for London (TfL) decided to stop work on a project to provide step-free access at Amersham and five other stations, on the grounds that these are relatively quiet stations and some are already one or two stops away from an existing step-free station. The next station towards London, Chalfont & Latimer, and Chesham station, around 2 miles (3.2\u00a0km) north, both have step-free access.

In late 2006 the new entrance on the south side of Euston Road opened in a corner of the new headquarters of the Wellcome Trust replacing the old entrance. There is also a subway entrance on the north side of Euston Road. In December 2005 Network Rail announced plans to create a subway link between the station and Euston station as part of the re-development of Euston station. This will create a direct link for users of heavy rail services which terminate at Euston. These plans would also be pursued during a rebuilding for High Speed 2. Both Warren Street and Euston tube stations are within close walking distance. In early 2011 two new lifts linking the westbound platform to the street opened.

The station is on the Uxbridge branch of both the Metropolitan line and Piccadilly line, between Rayners Lane and Ruislip Manor stations. The station is located on Field End Road. It is in Travelcard Zone 5. The Metropolitan Railway (Harrow and Uxbridge Railway) constructed the line between Harrow-on-the-Hill and Uxbridge and commenced services on 4 July 1904 with, initially, Ruislip being the only intermediate stop. At first, services were operated by steam trains, but track electrification was completed in the subsequent months and electric trains began operating on 1 January 1905. Progressive development in the north Middlesex area over the next two decades lead to the gradual opening of additional stations along the Uxbridge branch to encourage the growth of new residential areas. Eastcote opened on 26 May 1906 as Eastcote Halt. On 1 March 1910, an extension of the District Line from South Harrow to connect with the Metropolitan Railway at Rayners Lane was opened enabling District Line trains to serve stations between Rayners Lane and Uxbridge from that date. On 23 October 1933 District Line services were replaced by Piccadilly Line trains. The station was rebuilt between 1937 and 1939 to a design by Charles Holden which features the large cube-shaped brick and glass ticket hall capped with a flat reinforced concrete roof and geometrical forms typical of the new stations built in this period. The station is surrounded by the suburb of Eastcote; the original centre, now known as Old Eastcote is some distance away. The Cavendish Pavilion nearby was a popular destination for outings in the first part of the twentieth century.",

The steps to the station exit are towards the rear of the train when heading northbound, or front when heading southbound. The Metropolitan Railway began running services through here on 25 May 1885 with the opening of its Pinner extension. North Harrow station opened on 22 March 1915. The station was rebuilt in 1930 to the designs of Charles Clark as part of the Metropolitan Railway's modernisation programme Currently the art on display are photocopied pictures of local people painted over with coloured paint in various places, made by a local disabled children's group. It has two main exits but in recent years only one is in use, towards the town centre, presumably due to the setup of the barriers not requiring both. There is a direct door into a neighbouring coffee shop. The area under the train bridge outside the exit to the station is prone to flooding at times due to its low-lying position.",

                "abstract": "Quainton Road railway station was opened in 1868 in undeveloped countryside near Quainton, Buckinghamshire, 44 miles (71\u00a0km) from London. Built by the Aylesbury and Buckingham Railway, it was the result of pressure from the 3rd Duke of Buckingham to route the railway near his home at Wotton House and to open a railway station at the nearest point to it. Serving a relatively unpopulated area, Quainton Road was a crude railway station, described as \"extremely primitive\". Following the opening of the station, the Duke of Buckingham built a short horse-drawn tramway to assist with the transport of goods between his estates at Wotton and a terminus adjacent to the existing Quainton Road station. Extended soon afterwards to provide a passenger service to the town of Brill, the tramway was converted to locomotive operation, becoming known as the Brill Tramway. All goods to and from the Brill Tramway passed through Quainton Road station, making it relatively heavily used despite its geographical isolation, and traffic increased further when construction began on Ferdinand de Rothschild's mansion of Waddesdon Manor. It was proposed to extend the Brill Tramway to Oxford, which would have made Quainton Road a major junction station, but the plans were abandoned. Instead, the Aylesbury and Buckingham Railway and the Brill Tramway were absorbed by London's Metropolitan Railway (MR), who already operated the line from Aylesbury to London. The MR rebuilt Quainton Road station and re-sited it to a more convenient location, allowing direct running of services between the Brill Tramway and the Aylesbury and Buckingham Railway. When the Great Central Railway (GCR) from the north of England opened, Quainton Road became a significant junction at which trains from four directions met, and by far the busiest of the MR's rural stations. In 1933 the Metropolitan Railway was taken into public ownership to become the Metropolitan Line of the London Underground, and despite its distance from London Quainton Road became a part of the London Transport system. The management of London Transport aimed to move away from freight operations, and saw no way in which the rural parts of the MR system could be made into viable passenger routes. In 1935 the Brill Tramway was closed altogether. From 1936 London Underground services were withdrawn, leaving the GCR as the only operator still using the station, although London Underground services were restored for a short period in the 1940s. In 1958 passenger services on most of the GCR were withdrawn. Trains continued to serve Quainton Road for a short time after that, but in 1963 passenger services were withdrawn and in 1966 goods services were withdrawn and the station was closed. In 1969 the Quainton Road Society was formed, with the aim of preserving the station. In 1971 the Quainton Road Society absorbed the London Railway Preservation Society, taking over its collection of historic railway equipment. The station was fully restored and reopened as a museum, the Buckinghamshire Railway Centre. In addition to the original station buildings, the museum has also acquired the former Oxford Rewley Road railway station and a London Transport building from Wembley Park, both of which have been reassembled on the site. Although no scheduled trains pass through Quainton Road, the station remains connected to the railway network. Freight trains still use the line through the station, and passenger trains still call at the station for special events at the Buckinghamshire Railway Centre.",

The station is on the Uxbridge branch of both the Metropolitan line and Piccadilly line, between Eastcote and Ruislip stations. The station is located on Victoria Road, where the line crosses on a bridge: there are two curved entrances, with access to the platforms being by stairways. It is in Travelcard Zone 6. The closest station on the Central line is Ruislip Gardens. The Metropolitan Railway constructed the line through Ruislip Manor between Harrow on the Hill and Uxbridge and commenced services on 4 July 1904 with, initially, the only intermediate stop being at Ruislip. At first, services were operated by steam trains, but track electrification was completed in the subsequent months and electric trains began operating on 1 January 1905. On 1 March 1910, an extension of the District Line from South Harrow to connect with the Metropolitan Railway at Rayners Lane was opened enabling District Line trains to serve stations between Rayners Lane and Uxbridge from that date. Progressive development in the west Middlesex area over the next two decades lead to the gradual opening of additional stations along the Uxbridge branch to encourage the growth of new residential areas. Ruislip Manor opened on 5 August 1912 as Ruislip Manor Halt. On 23 October 1933 District Line services were replaced by Piccadilly Line trains. During the 1930s the number of passengers using the station increased greatly - from 17,000 in 1931 to 1.25m in 1937. To serve this enlarged number, a rebuilt station was opened on 26 June 1938. The station was given a major overhaul during 2005-2006. Both platforms were sequentially rebuilt, resulting in trains not stopping at each platform for a period of approximately four months. Work was completed in Autumn 2006. Local Green Party members commented that improved disability access has not been included in this overhaul. The station has a seemingly above average number of stairs up to the platforms, as the station is raised a significant amount above street-height in order to allow tall vehicles to pass beneath the station bridge, which is immediately before the station.",

Built and owned by the Duke of Buckingham, it was later operated by London's Metropolitan Railway, and in 1933 briefly became one of the two north-western termini of the London Underground, despite being 45 miles (72\u00a0km) and over two hours travelling time from the City of London. Approximately \u20444 of a mile (1.2\u00a0km) north of Brill, the station was opened in March 1872 as the result of lobbying from local residents and businesses. As the line was cheaply built, ungraded, and used poor quality locomotives, services were very slow, taking 1\u00a0hour 45\u00a0minutes to travel the six miles (10\u00a0km) from Brill to the junction station with mainline services at Quainton Road. Although serving a lightly populated area and little used by passengers, the station was a significant point for freight traffic, particularly as a supplier of milk from the dairy farms of Buckinghamshire to Aylesbury and London. A brickworks was also attached to the station, but it proved unable to compete with nearby rivals and closed within a few years of opening. During the 1890s, plans were made to extend the tramway to Oxford, but the scheme was abandoned. Instead, the operation of the line was taken over by the Metropolitan Railway in 1899, and the line became one of the railway's two north-western termini. It was upgraded and better quality locomotives were introduced, reducing the journey time to Quainton Road by almost two-thirds. In 1933, the Metropolitan Railway was taken into public ownership and became the Metropolitan Line of London Transport. The management of London Transport aimed to reduce goods services, and it was felt that there was little chance of the more distant parts of the former Metropolitan Railway ever becoming viable passenger routes. The line was closed on 30 November 1935, and all buildings and infrastructure at Brill associated with the line were sold at auction and subsequently demolished. The site of the station is now a light industrial development known as the \"Tramway Business Park\".",

The station was renamed St Johns Wood on 1 April 1925 and Lords on 11 June 1939. The name of the station refers to the nearby Lord's Cricket Ground. In the mid 1930s the Metropolitan Line was suffering congestion at the south end of its main route where trains from its many branches were struggling to share the limited capacity of its tracks between Finchley Road and Baker Street stations. To ease this congestion a new section of deep-level tunnel was constructed between Finchley Road and the Bakerloo Line tunnels at Baker Street station. The Metropolitan line's Stanmore branch services were then transferred to the Bakerloo Line on 20 November 1939 and diverted to run into Baker Street in the new tunnels, thus reducing the number of trains using the Metropolitan Line's tracks. Metropolitan Line stations between Finchley Road and Baker Street were closed and a new St. John's Wood station was opened nearby on what was then the Stanmore branch of the Bakerloo Line, now the Jubilee line. The surface building survived into the late 1960s before it was demolished. Its close proximity to the main line out of Marylebone railway station has led to proposals to open a new interchange close to the vicinity of the former Lord's Station. This is not a high priority project, but tied into a longer-term strategy to consider re-opening former inner-city stations on Main Lines. Recent reports from Transport for London suggest this is not likely to happen in the next 30 years.",

Some trains from London do terminate at Northwood, due to the placement of two sidings, but this usually happens when there are engineering works or delays north of Northwood. The old goods sidings still exist at Northwood but the old goods depot has been demolished and the station car park has replaced it.

The station was opened on 1 September 1887 on the Metropolitan Railway's extension from the previous terminus at Pinner, en route to Rickmansworth. The station was rebuilt in the late 1950s and early 1960s to include platforms on the newly quadrupled Watford slow lines rather than the Amersham fast lines. The station is located just off the main road through the town, Green Lane.

A lobbying campaign by residents of the town of Brill led to the tramway being converted for passenger use and extended a short distance beyond Wood Siding to Brill railway station in 1872, becoming known as the Brill Tramway. Cheaply built and ungraded, and using poor quality locomotives, services on the line were very slow, initially limited to a speed of 5 miles per hour (8\u00a0km\/h). In the 1890s it was planned to extend the tramway to Oxford, but the scheme was abandoned. Instead, the operation of the line was taken over by the Metropolitan Railway in 1899. Between 1908 and 1910 the station was completely rebuilt on a bridge over the newly built Chiltern Main Line of the Great Western Railway, which passed directly beneath the station. In 1933 the Metropolitan Railway was taken into public ownership and became the Metropolitan Line of London Transport. As a result, Wood Siding became a station on the London Underground network, despite being over 45 miles (72\u00a0km) from the City of London. London Transport's new management aimed to move away from goods services to concentrate on passenger services. As the line served a very lightly populated rural area, the new management believed it very unlikely that it could ever be made viable. Wood Siding was closed, along with the rest of the line, from 30 November 1935. Although all infrastructure associated with the station was removed in 1936, the remains of the bridge which supported the station were not demolished and are still in place.",

Part of a private horse-drawn tramway designed to carry freight from and around his lands in Buckinghamshire, Wotton station was intended to serve the Duke's home at Wotton House and the nearby village of Wotton Underwood. In 1872 the line was extended to the nearby town of Brill, converted to passenger use, equipped with steam locomotives, and renamed the Brill Tramway. In the 1880s, it was proposed to extend the line to Oxford, but the operation of the line was instead taken over by London's Metropolitan Railway. Although situated in an unpopulated area, Wotton station was relatively well used. It saw the highest passenger numbers of any station on the line other than the terminus at Brill railway station and the junction with the main line to London at Quainton Road railway station, and it also carried large quantities of milk from the area's dairy farms. In 1906 the Great Western and Great Central Joint Railway (commonly known as the Alternative Route) was opened, crossing the Brill Tramway at Wotton. Although the lines were not connected, a station was built on the new line very near the existing Wotton station; the two stations shared a stationmaster. In 1933 the Metropolitan Railway, which leased the line, was taken into public ownership and became the Metropolitan Line of London Transport. As a consequence, despite being a small rural station 49 miles (79\u00a0km) by train from the City of London, Wotton became a station on the London Underground. Frank Pick, the Chief Executive of the London Passenger Transport Board, aimed to abandon freight operations on the London Underground network, and saw no way in which the more distant parts of the former Metropolitan Railway could ever become viable passenger routes. As a result, all passenger services north of Aylesbury were withdrawn between 1935 and 1936; the last trains on the Brill Tramway ran on 30\u00a0November 1935. The line then reverted to the descendants of the Duke of Buckingham, but having no funds and no rolling stock they were unable to operate it. On 2\u00a0April 1936, the line's entire infrastructure, including Wotton station, was sold for scrap at auction. Except for a small building which once housed the Brill Tramway's forge, all the station buildings at Wotton have been demolished.",

The station was part of the world's first underground railway, the Metropolitan Railway, which opened between \"Bishop's Road\" on the Hammersmith &amp; City line and \"Farringdon Street\" (close to the present-day Farringdon station). It was opened on 10 January 1863 as \"Portland Road\", renamed \"Great Portland Street and Regents Park\" in 1923 and changed to its present name on 1 March 1917. The current structure was built in 1930 on a traffic island on the Marylebone Road at its intersection with Great Portland Street and Albany Street. Its construction is a steel framed cream terracotta clad exterior, with the perimeter providing shops and originally a car showroom with office space over the station. Great Portland Street was at a major sales location for the motor industry. It was designed by the architect C.W. Fowler and Grade II listed in January 1987. Local points of interest include Regent's Park, and the Post Office Tower. The station is very close to Regent's Park station, which is on the Bakerloo line.

The station serves all three of the Chalfonts; Chalfont St Giles, Chalfont St Peter and Little Chalfont &mdash; as well as the village of Latimer. It is located in Little Chalfont. It opened as \"Chalfont Road\" with the new line on 8 July 1889 but changed to the present name from 1 November 1915. The station is a good place to alight for walks in the Chilterns and the Chess Valley. Chalfont &amp; Latimer station was formerly served by steam hauled Metropolitan Line trains from Aylesbury to London, with a changeover to an electric locomotive at Rickmansworth. The electrification north of Rickmansworth (to Amersham as well as the Chesham branch) was completed in 1960, with steam trains being finally withdrawn in 1961. British Railways took over the operation of the service north of Amersham at the same time, using Class 115 diesel multiple unit trains. Mainline trains from London Marylebone to Sheffield via the former Great Central Railway line passed through the station without stopping; this service was withdrawn in 1966. The station had a goods yard, which closed on 14 November 1966. Since the early 1960s, Metropolitan Line trains at Chalfont &amp; Latimer have been formed of A60 and A62 Stock. Until 11 December 2010 the Chesham branch was served by a single four car unit (using Chalfont &amp; Latimer station's bay platform), except for two through trains in either direction during peak-periods. From 12 December 2010, the Chesham service will be formed of eight cars with new S Stock trains being gradually being introduced.

The station is the nearest to Portobello Road Market and market traders and shopkeepers in the market have started a campaign to have the station renamed Portobello Road in an effort to strengthen recognition of the market's proximity. In 2009, because of financial constraints, TfL decided to stop work on a project to provide step-free access at Ladbroke Grove and five other stations, on the grounds that these are relatively quiet stations and some are already one or two stops away from an existing step-free station. Ladbroke Grove is two stops away from Wood Lane which has step-free access.

The District Line was electrified in 1905 and the service was cut back from Upminster to East Ham; the station then served as the eastern terminus, where passengers transferred to steam trains, until 1908 when electrification was extended to Barking. In 1936 the Metropolitan Line service was introduced. In 1988 the station, along with other stations beyond Aldgate East, was transferred to the new Hammersmith & City line. The station has two platforms, one for each direction. A third bay platform on the northern side of the station, closed in 1958, connected to the Tottenham and Forest Gate Railway via a curve. LT&SR services, withdrawn in 1962, used platforms to the south of the current station. Much of the original Victorian station architecture has been retained and some restoration work was carried out during 2005.",

It opened on 15 December 1906 and was one of the original stations on the Great Northern, Piccadilly and Brompton Railway (GNP&amp;BR), now the Piccadilly line. It is located between King's Cross St Pancras and Caledonian Road, and had its entrance at the corner of York Road and Bingfield Street; the surface buildings are still clearly visible, on the left heading south down York Way towards King's Cross. The former platform area below is also visible from passing trains in both directions, although part of the eastbound platform is bricked off. As with most other disused underground stations, the platform itself has been removed. One of the passageways between the platforms is lit by a series of lamps. Unlike most other GNP&amp;BR stations, the lifts descended directly to platform level. The platform layout is almost identical to Caledonian Road (the next station to the north), but the two tracks form very gentle convex curves with respect to bases of the lift shafts between the tracks. Being in a poor industrial area, the station saw little use, and Sunday services were withdrawn from 5 May 1918. The station remained open for weekday traffic until 19 September 1932 when it closed permanently. The platform tiling was carried out by G. Woolliscroft &amp; Sons of Hanley in Staffordshire, and was made up of white with maroon and brick red patterning. Most of the tiling has since been painted over in grey, but a small section remains untouched and can be seen at the Finsbury Park end of the former eastbound platform. A small signalling cabin stands near this section of tiling, and was used to operate a crossover immediately to the northeast of the station. This signal box remained operational until 25 April 1964, although by this time the crossover was little used, having been largely superseded by a new crossover built at King's Cross eight years previously. However the disused cabin still stands and can be seen by observant passengers on passing trains.",

On the District and Circle lines, the station is between Gloucester Road and Sloane Square, and on the Piccadilly Line, it is between Gloucester Road and Knightsbridge. It is in Travelcard Zone 1. The main station entrance is located at the junction of Old Brompton Road, Thurloe Place, Harrington Road, Onslow Place and Pelham Street. Subsidiary entrances are located in Exhibition Road giving access by pedestrian tunnel to the Natural History, Science and Victoria and Albert Museums. Also close by are the Royal Albert Hall, Imperial College London, the Royal College of Music, the London branch of the Goethe-Institut and the Ismaili Centre. The station is in two parts: sub-surface platforms opened in 1868 by the Metropolitan Railway and the Metropolitan District Railway as part of the companies' extension of the Inner Circle route eastwards from Gloucester Road to Westminster and deep level platforms opened in 1906 by the Great Northern, Piccadilly and Brompton Railway. A variety of underground and mainline services have operated over the sub-surface tracks, which have been modified several times to suit operational demands with the current arrangement being achieved in the 1960s. The deep-level platforms have remained largely unaltered, although the installation of escalators in the 1970s to replace lifts improved interchanges between the two parts of the station. Parts of the sub-surface station and the Exhibition Road pedestrian tunnel are Grade II listed.",

Although situated underground, parts of the station's roofing are made of translucent ETFE laminate panels, allowing natural daylight to flood down both ends of all six platforms.

The station opened on the 12 April 1986 to serve the then recently opened Heathrow Terminal 4. It is situated on a unidirectional loop tunnel which was constructed between the existing Hatton Cross and Heathrow Terminals 1, 2, 3 stations. The station is one of the few on the London Underground to have only one platform, and is the only one with one-way train service. It is adjacent to Heathrow Terminal 4 railway station used by mainline Heathrow Connect railway services. In-service routing took trains from Hatton Cross to Terminal 4 then Terminals 1, 2, 3 and back to Hatton Cross. On 7 January 2005, both the loop track and the station were closed temporarily in order to allow the construction of a new rail junction to link to the new Heathrow Terminal 5 station. All trains reverted to using the original westbound track from Hatton Cross direct to Heathrow Terminals 1, 2, 3 which was used prior to the opening of Heathrow Terminal 4. For passengers travelling to or from Heathrow Terminal 4, a shuttle bus was provided from Hatton Cross tube station. This situation continued until 17 September 2006 when the loop line and station were reopened following completion of the construction, and with new security and customer announcement technologies in place at the station. Now that the new Heathrow Terminal 5 station has opened, the service pattern is that every other train arriving at Hatton Cross will run via the Heathrow Terminal 4 loop, whilst the alternate trains will run direct to Heathrow Terminals 1, 2, 3 and then continue down the new branch directly to Heathrow Terminal 5.

It straddles the border between the London Boroughs of Hackney and Haringey, the postal address and three of the entrances being in the former, and one entrance in the latter. The station, named after a nearby public house, is situated at the junction of Seven Sisters Road and Green Lanes and was designed by Charles Holden. Opened on 19 September 1932, it lies between Finsbury Park and Turnpike Lane tube stations. Like all stations on the Cockfosters extension, Manor House station set new aesthetic standards, not previously seen on London's Underground. The station was equipped with nine street level entrances, two of which gave access to tram routes to and from Tottenham, Edmonton and Stamford Hill via tramway island exits into Seven Sisters Road. The last of these tram services were withdrawn in 1938 and replaced by trolleybuses and the exits were removed in 1951. The sub-surface areas of the station were tiled in biscuit coloured tiles lined with blue friezes. These were refurbished in 2005. The station tunnels have, in common with those of Turnpike Lane and Wood Green, a diameter of 23 feet (7 metres) and were designed for the greater volume of traffic expected. In contrast, Bounds Green and Southgate have only 21 foot (6.4 metres) diameter platform tunnels. The construction of \"suicide pits\" between the rails was also innovative. These were built in connection with a system of passageways under the platforms to give access to the track. During the planning of the Victoria Line a proposal to transfer Manor House station to the Victoria Line was put forward. New tunnels were also proposed for the Piccadilly Line between Finsbury Park and Turnpike Lane, considerably reducing the travelling time from Outer North London to Central London. The inconvenience caused during re-construction, as well as the cost, ensured that the idea was not pursued. Next to the northern exit are the remains of a tramway track, which leads into the rear of the former Metropolitan Electric Tramways Headquarters (M.E. T) building, later the Eastern Divisional Office of London Transport Buses. Harringay Green Lanes railway station is about 650m away, northward along Green Lanes.",

The station opened on 15 December 1906. The station was constructed by the Great Northern, Piccadilly and Brompton Railway and was built with two lift shafts, but only one was ever used for lifts. The second shaft was the site of an experimental spiral escalator which was built by the American inventor of escalators, Jesse W. Reno. The experiment was not successful and was never used by the public. In the 1990s, remains of the escalator equipment were excavated from the base of the lift shaft. These are stored at the London Transport Museum Depot in Acton. From the platforms, you can see a second exit which is no longer in use. This exit leads to the back of the used lift shaft. The station is adjacent to the site of the former Holloway and Caledonian Road railway station. The station is close to the new Emirates Stadium, the new home of Arsenal football club. As part of the planning permission \u00a35m was due to be spent expanding the current station to cope with increased passenger numbers on match days. However subsequent studies showed that to ensure the station could cope with the numbers the lifts would have to be replaced with escalators which would cost \u00a360m. As a result the redevelopment plans were put on hold and now at match times the station is exit only, and before a match eastbound trains do not call.",

The station is on the Piccadilly Line, between Wood Green and Arnos Grove stations, and is on the boundary between Travelcard Zone 3 and fare_zone 4. Like all stations on the Cockfosters extension, Bounds Green station which opened on 19 September 1932, set new aesthetic standards, not previously seen on London's Underground. During the planning period of the extension to Cockfosters, alternate names for this station, \"Wood Green North\" and \"Brownlow Road\" were considered but rejected. Architecturally, this tube station, designed in the typical \"Box-style\" of the architect Charles Holden by his colleague C. H. James, is a well-preserved example of the modernist house style of London Transport in the 1930s. The octagonal frontage is flanked by a ventilation tower. Two escalators take passengers from the ticket hall down to the platforms with a central fixed stairway. These machines were installed in 1989 and 1991, replacing the original 1932 machines. The current installations are Otis MH-B type of 15.8m vertical rise. The sub-surface areas of the station are tiled in biscuit coloured tiles lined with red friezes. The station tunnels have, in common with those of Southgate, a diameter of 21 feet (6.4 metres). In contrast, the much busier Wood Green, Turnpike Lane and Manor House have 23 foot (7 metre) diameter platform tunnels. The construction of \"suicide pits\" between the rails was also innovative. These were built in connection with a system of passageways under the platforms to give access to the track. On the night of 13 October 1940, a lone German aircraft dropped a single bomb on houses to the north of the station. The destruction of the houses caused the north end of the westbound platform tunnel to collapse, killing or injuring many people amongst those sheltering from the air raid. The train service was disrupted for two months. A memorial plaque (at the north end of the westbound platform) erroneously commemorates \"sixteen Belgian refugees and... three British citizens who died\" in the attack. The records of the civilian deaths held by the Commonwealth War Graves Commission indicate that in fact sixteen people died at the scene - only three of whom were Belgian - with a seventeenth dying in hospital the following day. Approximately twenty people were injured, but survived. The station was refurbished as part of Transport for London\u2019s \u00a310 billion Investment Programme. The works were completed overnight and in a series of weekend closures. New train indicators were placed and much of the flooring and tiling has been cleaned\/replaced. Unlike others on this extension, the station was not previously nationally listed as of special architectural interest. As of August 2008 an application was made to English Heritage for a listing recommendation and in February 2010 the station was Listed at Grade II.",

The interchange consists of an interconnected National Rail station, London Underground station and two bus stations. The main entrances are by the eastern bus station on Station Place. The National Rail ticket office here lies in between one entrance marked by the Underground roundel symbol, while the other is marked by the National Rail symbol, and provides direct access to the main line platforms. There is another exit by the western bus station along Wells Terrace, incorporating the Underground ticket office, plus a narrow side entrance to the south on the A503 Seven Sisters Road. The complex is located in Travelcard Zone 2. The station is named after the nearby Finsbury Park, one of the oldest of London's Victorian parks. It is also used by many Arsenal supporters on matchdays, as the club's ground is just a short walk away. When the Victoria line was built in the 1960s, the walls in Finsbury Park station were decorated with mosaics of duelling pistols, which can still be seen. This was based on a mistaken identification of Finsbury Park with Finsbury Fields, which was used by Londoners since medieval times for archery and sports, and also associated with 18th-century duels and one of the first hot air balloon flights. However, Finsbury Fields actually occupied a location close to the present-day Finsbury Square. At the same time the long entrance subways and the Wells Terrace booking hall (at the bus station end) was rebuilt to a high standard. Finsbury Park station has a long and complex history involving the participation of many railway companies during its lifetime and has been subject to a number of operational changes and changes to the configuration of station infrastructure. British Transport Police maintain a presence at Finsbury Park and have a police station located at the Wells Terrace entrance. Ticket barriers were installed to platforms 1, 2, 5 and 6 in 2011.",

Like the rest of the original GNP&amp;BR stations, the street level station building and platform tiling was designed by Leslie Green. The station building is a classic red 'Oxblood' building which has two elevations fronting onto the end of James Street and Long Acre. The platform wall was tiled with two shades of yellow and white tiling which formed geometric shapes along with three blank spaces to incorporate the station name. As part of TFL's investment programme, the ageing tiling dating back from the station's opening has been replaced in 2010 in a like-for-like basis, retaining the look and feel of the platforms.",

It lies between Liverpool Street and Mile End stations, and in Travelcard Zone 2. The station was opened as part of the long planned Central Line eastern extension on 4 December 1946; before that it was used as an air-raid shelter. On 3 March 1943, 173 people were killed in a crush while attempting to enter the shelter. The station is an example of the \"New Works Programme 1935 - 1940\" style adopted by London Transport for its new tube stations. Extensive use is made of pale yellow tiling, originally manufactured by Poole Pottery. This has been replicated during the 2007 modernisation although several panels of original tiling were retained on the platforms. The finishes include relief tiles, showing symbols of London and the area served by the London Passenger Transport Board, designed by Harold Stabler. The station entrances, all in the form of subway access staircases to the subterranean ticket hall, all show the design influences of Charles Holden, the consulting architect for London Transport at this time.",

During the war, the station was used as an air raid shelter and the tunnels as a munitions factory for Plessey electronics. The station was finally completed and opened on 14 December 1947. During planning, the names \"Ilford North\" and \"Cranbrook\" were considered. The station, like many others on the same branch, was designed by notable Tube architect Charles Holden; during the planning period London Underground Holden advised on the construction of the new Moscow Metro, which is why the barrel-vaulted halls of Gants Hill echo many stations on the Russian capital's system. The station is located beneath Gants Hill roundabout, and reached via the pedestrian subway under the roundabout. There are three escalators from the ticket office to the platforms.",

The station was opened on 14 December 1947. Construction had begun in the 1930s but was delayed by the onset of World War 2. During the war, the completed train tunnels at Redbridge were used by the Plessey company as an aircraft parts factory. The station building was designed by renowned Tube architect, Charles Holden, who also designed other stations on the same branch. Originally, the station was to have been named \"West Ilford\", then this changed to \"Red House\", before the final decision was made on \"Redbridge\" (also given in the plans as \"Red Bridge\". ) Since the station was built, a large roundabout has been constructed next to it, being a junction between the A406 (originally the terminal section of the M11), and the A12. Redbridge is often described as the shallowest deep level (as opposed to cut and cover) station on the network, as it is only 5.2 metres (17\u00a0ft) beneath the surface. However, this is misleading as the station tunnel was constructed by the cut and cover method, with the running lines descending into genuine tube tunnels at either end of the platforms - similar to the Central Line platforms at Mile End. In July 2011 it was granted Grade II listed building status by English Heritage. It was also mentioned in the Department S episode The Last Train To Redbridge, although the actual station does not appear in it.",

It is on Hale Road near the Tottenham Hale one-way gyratory system. The station is in Travelcard Zone 3. The station opened on 15 September 1840 as Tottenham, on the Northern & Eastern Railway (N&ER) line from Stratford in east London to Broxbourne in Hertfordshire. It was renamed Tottenham Hale on 1 September 1968 when it became an interchange station with London Underground on the opening of the first stage of the Victoria line. The next station to the south on the line to Liverpool Street is Clapton but very few trains, except on Sundays, serve both Clapton and Tottenham Hale. Most trains either run non-stop between Liverpool Street and Tottenham Hale or make one intermediate stop at Hackney Downs. Clapton is almost exclusively served by trains going via the Chingford branch instead. From 11 December 2005, a new service between Stratford and Stansted Airport reintroduced a direct passenger connection between Tottenham Hale and Stratford via the mainly freight line across Walthamstow Marshes. Lea Bridge, a former station between Tottenham Hale and Stratford, may be re-opened in the future. In the late 1990s, at the same time as the Stansted Express service to Stansted Airport was started, the British Rail station at Tottenham Hale was totally rebuilt along with a revamp of the Underground station. None of the original Victorian station now exists. Two of London's last remaining Trolleybus poles still stand on Ferry Lane as it crosses over the railway tracks by the station.",

During its lifetime, the branch was the subject of a number of unrealised extension proposals that would have seen the tunnels through the station extended southwards, usually to Waterloo. Served by a shuttle train for most of their life and suffering from low passenger numbers, the station and branch were considered for closure several times. A weekday peak hours-only service survived until closure in 1994, when the cost of replacing the lifts was considered too high compared to the income generated. Disused parts of the station and the running tunnels were used during both World Wars to shelter artworks from London's public galleries and museums from bombing. The station has long been popular as a filming location and has appeared as itself and as other London Underground stations in a variety of films.

The surface building still exists on Kentish Town Road, close to the junction with Castle Road, and is currently a retail unit occupied by the Cash Converters chain. The station was opened on 22 June 1907 by the Charing Cross, Euston &amp; Hampstead Railway (CCE&amp;HR), as part of its branch to Highgate (now Archway) station. The station was to be called Castle Road however this was changed just before the station opened. This name was fired into the original Leslie Green tiles however, after the name was changed, these tiles were just painted over. The station was temporarily closed following strike action at the Lots Road power station during the afternoon of 5 June 1924, trains having called at the station that morning. In the event it was decided not to re-open the station after the power was restored due to the very low number of passengers using the station. During World War II it was used as an air raid shelter. There have been occasional proposals to rebuild the platforms and the station as part of the redevelopment plans for Camden Town station. The layout of the station is similar to Kentish Town (also CCE&amp;HR); with two 23\u00a0ft diameter lift shafts and an 18\u00a0ft diameter spiral staircase. The station now serves as an access point for permanent way works and as an emergency egress point for passenger services. A prose piece called South Kentish Town was written in 1951 by Sir John Betjeman, and told the fictional story of a passenger who became trapped in the disused station.

The second part of the station's name was adopted from the nearby Twyford Abbey. The new Park Royal station was built for the extension of Piccadilly Line services to South Harrow and was located further south to provide access from the Western Avenue (A40) road constructed in the 1920s. Nothing of the old station remains.

It was in the City of London, on King William Street, just south of the present Monument station. When the station was in operation the next station south was Borough and the southern terminus of the line was Stockwell. King William Street opened on 18 December 1890 and was constructed from a large masonry station tunnel accessed from the surface by a lift shaft or spiral staircase. Two platforms were provided, one on each side of the single, central track\u2014one for passengers entering and one for passengers leaving the trains\u2014a system later referred to as the Spanish solution. The station tunnel itself is situated beneath Monument Street and runs east-west across King William Street, ending beneath Arthur Street. The approach running tunnels had sharp curves and steep gradients in order to dive underneath the River Thames while remaining under public rights-of-way, in particular Swan Lane and Arthur Street. The combination of station layout and poor alignment of the running tunnels severely limited the capacity of the station and in the years after opening a number of initiatives were made to improve operations. In 1895 a central island platform with tracks each side was constructed to enable two trains to occupy the station at once; however, capacity remained restricted. When the line was extended northwards to Moorgate station, new running tunnels on a different alignment, but still beneath Borough High Street, were constructed running from below St George the Martyr's Church, north of Borough station to a new station at London Bridge station and onwards to an alternative City station at Bank. Under the river Thames the present running tunnels of the northern line are situated to the east of London Bridge, whereas the King William St tunnels pass to the west of the bridge, the southbound tunnel below the northbound as the line passes under the Thames. The station closed on 24 February 1900. The original station building was demolished in the 1930s, although the parts of the station below ground were converted for use as a public air-raid shelter during World War II. Access today is via a manhole in the basement of Regis House, a modern day office building, where the original cast iron spiral staircase leads down to platform level. The lift shaft was infilled with concrete during the construction of the original Regis House. The original running tunnels north of Borough tube station remain, although when the Jubilee Line Extension was built in the late 1990s the old southbound tunnel was cut through as part of the construction works at London Bridge station in order to provide the lift shaft situated at the south end of the northern line platforms. These running tunnels now serve as a ventilation shaft for the station and the openings for several adits to the old running tunnels can be seen in the roofs of the Northern Line platform tunnels and in the central concourse between them. A construction shaft between London Bridge and King William Street, beneath Old Swan Wharf, now serves as a pump shaft for the disused sections of running tunnels. It is no longer possible to walk through between the two stations as the old C&SLR running tunnels have been blocked off with concrete bulkheads either side of the River Thames.",

The station was built in 1911 to a design by architect Gerald Horsley, son of the painter John Calcott Horsley. It has two platforms. The northbound (down) platform is on the side of the ticket office and cafe. The southbound (up) platform is reached via a footbridge. This platform was originally an island platform with the other face on the adjacent down fast mainline. There was another island platform serving the up fast and down semi-fast lines and a further platform for the up semi-fasts. These other platforms fell out of use before the end of steam services on the mainline. A general rebuilding of the access to the two remaining platforms in use was built in the 1980s and a fence built along to shield waiting passengers from the fast trains.",
